# Options Pricing: Practice Tool

### Inspiration
In my first year as an options trader at Susquehanna International Group, I created this tool to help me practice pricing equity options. As a trader, it was incredibly important that I be able to quickly and accurately price an options board (i.e. the calls & puts at various strike prices for a given expiration), determine at what price I would be willing to trade various market orders, and adjust my fair values given these market orders.

This tool provides a practice options board with just enough initial information for the user to impute fair values for the entire board. Once the user has determined their fair values and made their markets, the tool has the ability to generate random market orders that the user can practice pricing. Finally, the tool has the ability to adjust the stock price of the board, allowing the user to practice thinking through how their fair values change given stock price fluctuations.


### Details
There are four excel sheets in the document. The first sheet is a simplified version of an equity options board with two months. Five strikes are included in each month, the call options are to be entered on the left side, and the puts on the right. The stock market is given at the top (here, the best stock bid is 78.27 and the best offer is 78.29) (see Pic1):
